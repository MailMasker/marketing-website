        <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
        <h4>1. Terms & Introduction</h4>
        <p>
          These terms of service (the "Terms of Service") describe your rights
          and responsibilities when using the Mail Masker application (referred
          to as the "Website" when accessed via a browser, and the "Platform"
          when accessed via any means). These Terms of Service, our Privacy
          Policy, and any other terms agreed to in writing by you and us
          (referred to collectively as the "Terms") govern your use of the
          Platform. By accessing or using the Platform, you acknowledge that you
          have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by and comply
          with these Terms. If you do not agree with any of these Terms, you may
          not use the Platform. You understand and agree that satisfying the
          above requirements does not guarantee that you will access, use, or
          provide services through the Platform. In these Terms, the terms "you"
          and "yours" refer to the entity on whose behalf these Terms are
          entered into. The terms "we", "our", "us", "Mail Masker" and "Dewpoint
          Solutions" refer to Dewpoint Solutions, Inc. Even though you may have
          arrived to the Platform through a website or mobile application
          operated or controlled by a third party, including by an affiliate of
          Mail Masker, you understand and agree that these Terms are entered
          into between you and Dewpoint Solutions. You also understand and agree
          that the Platform and any services provided through these Terms are
          provided solely by Dewpoint Solutions, and no other parent,
          subsidiary, or affiliate of Dewpoint Solutions. Any person using or
          accessing the Platform for or on behalf of you represents and warrants
          that they have the authority to use the Website and agree to these
          Terms on your behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
